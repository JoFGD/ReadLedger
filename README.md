# ReadLedger
Python functions to convert a string ledger into a list of tuples and compute the total balance for each individual in said ledger. 
There is an additional function which merges two ledgers to produce a list of entries sorted by date (achieved without the use of a sort algorithm).

All of this is part of a slightly larger project to create a very basic blockchain structure using concepts from Merkle trees.
